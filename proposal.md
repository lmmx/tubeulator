At a high level, this project aims to create a transport data processing application using the TfL
data API, OpenAPI schema, TinyDB, and Python. The main components of the project are:

1. OpenAPI schema processing: This part of the project uses the OpenAPI schema provided by TfL to
understand the structure and types of data available through their API. The schema helps in parsing
the data and defining the data models used in the application.

2. TinyDB database: The TinyDB database is used to store the data retrieved from the TfL API. The
data is stored in JSON-style documents, which are then converted to BSON types for TinyDB. This
allows efficient storage and retrieval of the transport data for further processing and analysis.

3. Python code for core abstractions: The project uses Python to implement the core abstractions,
such as journey, station, line, etc., which represent the key components of the transport network.
These abstractions are used to build the logic and functionality of the application, such as route
planning, time estimation, and other features.

The project can work as follows:

1. The Python code communicates with the TfL data API to fetch transport data related to the
underground, overground, bus, and walking routes. The fetched data is parsed using the OpenAPI
schema to create Python objects corresponding to the core abstractions.

2. The data is then stored in the TinyDB database for efficient storage and retrieval. This allows
the application to quickly access the transport data as needed, without having to fetch it from the
TfL API each time.

3. The core abstractions implemented in Python are used to build the features of the application,
such as route planning and time estimation. This includes finding the best route between two
locations, taking into account various factors such as the mode of transport, walking time, and
interconnections.

4. The application can be further customized by allowing users to specify preferences, such as
avoiding certain areas, preferring faster routes, or minimizing walking time.

Overall, this project combines the power of the TfL data API, OpenAPI schema, TinyDB, and Python to
create a comprehensive transport data processing application that provides valuable insights and
features for users navigating the transport network.
